#Multiple R-squared:  0.6511,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6438 
#This means that 65.11% of the variation in stopping distance is explained by speed

#(b)
#For B0=-17.58, This means that at a speed of 0 mph the stopping distance is -17.58 feet. Which doesn't make any sense but it helps with determining the model.
#For B1=3.93, This means for every 1 mph increase in speed, the stopping distance is increased by 3.93 feet.
#This is significant. The p-value is basically 0 (p-value: 1.49e-12), so the relationship is statistically significant. Thus, speed has a great impact on stopping distance.

#(b)

#Residuals vs Fitted: The residuals are not perfectly random; there's a slight curved trend, suggesting non-linearity in the relationship between size and price.
#Q-Q Residuals: Residuals are approximately normally distributed, but a few high values are mild outliers.
#Scale-Location: This suggests the variance of residuals may increase with fitted values.
#Residuals vs Leverage: A few observations (e.g., 64, 74, 44) are moderately influential, but none exceed Cookâ€™s distance threshold.
