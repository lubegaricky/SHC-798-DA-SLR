```{r, Part-1}
# Getting Started with the Dataset:
pacman::p_load(ggplot2) # checks if ggplot2 is installed;if it's not installed, it automatically installs it first, then loads it. If it's already installed, it just loads it into your current R session

head(mpg) # View first few rows of the dataset
summary(mpg) # Get an overview of the dataset

# --- Add ----
str(mpg)
view(mpg)
# -------------

#Analyse the mpg dataset using descriptive methods

#(a)
# average city and highway fuel economy across all vehicle classes
afe <- aggregate(cbind(cty, hwy) ~ class, data = mpg, FUN = mean)
